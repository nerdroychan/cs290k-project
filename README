protos/dfs.proto: Definitions of gRPC interfaces
Makefile:         The Makefile
dfs_client.cpp:   Client code
dfs_server.cpp:   Server code

=== Usage ===

Simply run `make` and the executable files are generated (dfs_server and
dfs_client). The server listens to 0.0.0.0:50051.

Every function is implemented except the filter (due to time limitation; I
was on travel). You may use the programs as stated in the document.

=== Notes ===

Change CWD:
    CWD is maintained on the server-side so `chdir` won't change the local
CWD. The local CWD is always the birth place of the client process.

Multi-user:
    Multiple clients are supported but they share the same namespace
(e.g. one client changing CWD will make the other users' CWD be changed).

Path namespace:
    When using local and remote paths, be careful about the namespace. The
local path should follow the local CWD and the remote path should follow the
remote CWD.

Jail:
    Users cannot change directory to the outside world of the initial CWD of
the server process.
